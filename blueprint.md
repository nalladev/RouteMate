# RouteMate App Blueprint

## Overview

RouteMate is a Flutter application designed to be a comprehensive route planning and navigation assistant. This document outlines the project's architecture, design principles, and feature implementation.

## Style, Design, and Features

This section documents the implemented features and design choices from the initial version to the current one.

### Initial Setup & Troubleshooting (Session 1)

*   **Project Initialization:** Standard Flutter project created.
*   **Package Name Change:** The user requested to change the Android application ID from the default `com.example.myapp` to `com.routemate.app`.
*   **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    1.  **Firebase Configuration:** Initially suspected a Firebase configuration issue due to the app crashing on startup after the name change.
    2.  **`build.gradle.kts` fix:** Identified that the `applicationId` in `android/app/build.gradle.kts` was still set to the old package name. Updated it to `com.routemate.app`.
    3.  **`adb logcat` Debugging:** Used `adb logcat` to get detailed crash logs when the app continued to fail.
    4.  **`ClassNotFoundException`:** The logs revealed a `ClassNotFoundException` for `com.routemate.app.MainActivity`, indicating the main activity file was not in the correct package directory.
    5.  **File Relocation:** Moved `MainActivity.kt` from `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/myapp/` to `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/routemate/app/`.
    6.  **Package Declaration Fix:** Updated the `package` declaration inside `MainActivity.kt` from `com.example.myapp` to `com.routemate.app`.

## Current Task: Fix App Crash After Package Name Change

*   **Goal:** Resolve the application crash that occurred after attempting to change the Android package name.
*   **Status:** **Completed**
*   **Plan & Steps Executed:**
    1.  Investigate build and runtime errors.
    2.  Correct the `applicationId` in the Android build configuration (`build.gradle.kts`).
    3.  Use `adb logcat` to diagnose the persistent crash.
    4.  Identify and fix the incorrect location and package declaration of the `MainActivity.kt` file.
    5.  Run the application to confirm the fix.
